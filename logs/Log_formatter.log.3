2021-02-23 08:59:43:INFO    - 
 In order to initialize your database's metadata, Marmot is looking for a h5plexos solution file.  
 It is looking in /Users/mschwarz/OR OSW local/Solutions/mid_Aug_newCascadetx, but it cannot find any *.h5 files there. 
 Please check the 'PLEXOS_Solutions_folder' input in row 2 of your 'Marmot_user_defined_inputs.csv'. 
 Ensure that it matches the filepath containing the *.h5 files created by h5plexos. 
 
 Marmot will now quit.
